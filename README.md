# odin-recipes

My first Odin Project integrating all that I have learned. From Cloning a repository from Git to my pc to creating a recipe HTML Document.
This project is created in order to practice HTML and CSS. We will be modifying this project as we move along the course. 

I will be creating a recipe site. with links leading to different recipes.
